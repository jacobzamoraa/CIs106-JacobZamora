How to make a turkey sandwich
1. Start with two pieces of white bread that you grab from the cabinet.
2. Open the bread package and grab two slices of bread. 
3. After you have grabbed the bread, go to the fridge and grab the following items: mayo, lettuce, cheese, and turkey slices.
4. While both slices are spread open with nothing on them, open the jar of mayo and put the mayo on both pieces of the bread with a butter knife from the kitchen drawer.
5. After you put on the mayo, then open up your cheese, that is already cut, and grab two slices and put them on either side of the bread.
6. Once you have put the mayo and cheese on, next you have to get a sharper knife from your drawer and grab the lettuce.
7. Break off two stalks of lettuce, rinse them under the kitchen water, then continue to cut off the ends with your knife.
8. Once that is done, then grab your two stalks of lettuce and put them on either side of the bread again.
9. Then, you grab your package of turkey, open it with your hands, grab two slices, close the bag, and put both slices on either side of the bread.
10. Once you have done that go ahead and grab your mayo, lettuce, cheese, and turkey and open the fridge and put them back.
11. After that, grab your package of bread, tie it back up, and put it back in the cabinet. 
12. Once that is done, go back to your sandwich, grab the left slice of bread, and put it on top of your right slice of bread.
13. Go back to the cabinet and grab a plate, then grab your sandwich and put it on top of the plate.
14. Your sandwich is done and is ready to be eaten.
