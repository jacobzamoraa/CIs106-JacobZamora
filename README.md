## Assignment 1

I am taking this course to get the fundamentals of computer programming. I am super excited and interested in this topic as I have never learned about programming. This course also helps me with my transfer credits. This course shows that I have experience with computer codes and programming which will later help me get an engineering job that works with codes and a lot of hands-on experience with computer programming. I also love computers and gaming, so getting more into the actual computer and learning how to use these codes interest me. I am just hoping that I get the full experience because this is an online course. online is going to be a little harder to understand but I am trying my best to keep up.
