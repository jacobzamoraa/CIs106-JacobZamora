## Assignment 1

I am taking this course to get the fundamentals of computer programming. I am super excited and interested in this topic as I have never learned about programming. This course also helps me with my transfer credits. This course shows that I have experience with computer codes and programming which will later help me get an engineering job that works with codes and a lot of hands-on experience with computer programming. I also love computers and gaming, so getting more into the actual computer and learning how to use these codes interest me. I am just hoping that I get the full experience because this is an online course. online is going to be a little harder to understand but I am trying my best to keep up. 

## Assignment 2
The programming language I selected was python. I selected this language because you told us that this is a popular and easier language for beginners. I intend to use this language for our class when doing assignments. I also intend to practice and try to use this language to the full extent. I tested the Thonny ide and I also intend to use the Thonny Ide program for this course. 

## Assignment 3 
What I learned about programming for this assignment is how to make basic flowcharts of procedures. I also got the feeling of using flowgorithm and python much better and easier. I pretty much have the hang of it now and it is not as confusing as before. The more I use it and really focus on what I am doing, the more I understand. How you can use flowcharts in everyday life is if you are in a business, you use flowcharts to show how orders or purchases are done as well as showing pricing in a business. 

## Assignment 4
In session 4, I learned a little more about using the Python language. I tried using Python online instead of Flowgorithm but I had a hard time making the prompt work. I learned a little more about how to use it and enter information to make it work but still couldn't make a full working program, so I ended up going back to Flowgorithm and finishing it there. After using Python a lot more, I realized that you can use this language to instruct people on how to complete a prompt through IDE if they didn't know-how. You can use this in your life to show step by step on how to get the answer to the prompt. (Update) I figured out how to use python and re-submitted my work. I hope that it is correct and when I tested it, the program did work. 

## Assignment 5
In session 5, I learned how to create a function to make programming easier instead of typing in the same equation every time, I learned how to make a short cut using function. I would type in the function name and it would already have the equation saved into it rather than me typing the equation everytime I use it. I had a hard time how to figure out how to properly use functions in Flowgorithm. After watching a video that the professor prived to us in Blackboard it helped me much more in understanding the process of making a function. This helps in every day life because it creates short cuts.
